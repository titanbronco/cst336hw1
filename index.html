                    Artificial intelligence is a section in the study of Computer Science that focuses on creating intelligent machines that are capable of completing human tasks in an efficient manner.

                    Artificial intelligence focuses on programming machines to possess certain traits such as:
                </p>
                
                <ul id="traits">
                    <li>Knowledge</li>
                    <li>Reasoning</li>
                    <li>Perception</li>
                    <li>Learning</li>
                    <li>Just about any traits posessed by humans used to complete tasks</li>
                </ul>
                
                <br />
                
                <p>
                    By utilizing machine learning in order to endow machines with traits possessed by humans such as those listed above, machines and robots can be enlisted to handle human tasks ranging from everyday life duties to complex tasks that are usually left to well-trained professionals.
