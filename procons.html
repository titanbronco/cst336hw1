                As you can see, when it comes to AI mankind as a whole has a ton to both gain and lose. On one hand, human quality of life skyrockets and we are free to do as we please with our time. Mundane tasks are handed off to our smart machines while we focus our time and efforts on advancement and leisure. On the other hand, the powerful potential of AI is both tapped and abused and the world ends up in a post-apocalyptic state from a number of AI-induced causes. We are living in the age of Artificial Intelligence and while the future could be bright or dark, it sure is exciting.
